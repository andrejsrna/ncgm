`Get Down` opens the Jazz & Bass catalogue with a head-nod groove. Ajex pairs syncopated double bass riffs with shimmering Fender Rhodes chords, letting a rolling breakbeat move the dance floor. Perfect for brand reels, cocktail lounge scenes, and underground skate editsâ€”just remember the catalogue is rights-managed, so license before publishing.
