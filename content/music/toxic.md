`Toxic` keeps the rights-managed Jazz & Bass energy flowing. Ajex blends sultry trumpet phrases with warm subs, evolving pads, and a relaxed two-step to create an effortless, candlelit roller. Ideal for cocktail lounge B-roll, chromatic fashion looks, and experiential campaigns once clearance is secured.
